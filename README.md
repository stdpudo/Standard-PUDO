## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to develop a Standard PUDO API and Data Format for a Greener Last Mile Delivery.

The Project aim to engage all the stakeholders involved into the ecommerce processes, facilitating and extending the PUDO uses/proposition for:
- Ecommerce Site and Online Marketplace
- Couriers and Postal Operators
- PUDO Carrier-Independent Networks
- IT Pre/Post delivery valued added service provider

The main outcome of the projects are:
- Standard API and Data Format for PUDO Discovery, Identification and Use 
- Standard Behavioural guidelines for Event Management
- Integration into the main e-commerce software
 
We aim to extend the standard Checkout Experience in a Environmentally oriented way, facilitating users and e-commerce sites to prefer PUDO delivery as their default, environmentally savy delivery preference.

The outcome of the API is meant to be flexible and developers oriented with:
- Swagger Technical Definition for a modern REST/JSON couple
- Source Code reference implementation in main software development languages

We aim to break with any legacy approach, such as [UPU Standards](https://www.upu.int/en/Postal-Solutions/Programmes-Services/Standards) used by Postal Operators or commonly used SOAP/XML used by Couriers.
