## Standard PUDO API

The goal of this project is to develop a Standard PUDO API and Data Format for a Greener Last Mile Delivery.

The Project aim to engage all the stakeholders involved into the ecommerce processes, facilitating and extending the PUDO uses/proposition for:
- Ecommerce Site and Online Marketplace
- Couriers and Postal Operators
- PUDO Carrier-Independent Networks
- IT Pre/Post delivery valued added service provider

The main outcome of the projects are:
- Standard API and Data Format for PUDO Discovery, Identification and Use 
- Standard Behavioural guidelines for Event Management
- Integration into the main e-commerce software, extending Checkout Experience in a Environmentally oriented way

The outcome of the API is meant to be flexible and developers oriented with:
- Swagger Technical Definition for a modern REST/JSON couple
- Source Code reference implementation in main software development languages

We aim to break with any legacy approach, such as [UPU Standards](https://www.upu.int/en/Postal-Solutions/Programmes-Services/Standards) used by Postal Operators or commonly used SOAP/XML used by Couriers.

### EXAMPLE FORMATTING

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/stdpudo/site/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/stdpudo/site/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
